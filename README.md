Analysis of stomach contents (1977-1981) and stable isotopes (1994) of the Everglades aquatic food web

This code is for the analyses in "Fishes in a seasonally pulsed wetland show spatiotemporal shifts in diet and trophic niche but not shifts in trophic position" (citation below). The necessary data files are archived through the Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological database at https://fcelter.fiu.edu/data/. R files are intended to be run in the order indicated by the leading numbers in the file name of each R script.
